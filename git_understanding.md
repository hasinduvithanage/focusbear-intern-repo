Research what causes merge conflicts in Git.

This happens when the same line of code is different in the main branch and the other branch that is to be merged to the main branch.

Create a merge conflict in your test repo by:
Creating a branch and editing a file.
Switching back to main, making a conflicting edit in the same file, and committing it.
Merging the branch back into main.

Use your Git desktop client to resolve the conflict.

Write about your experience:
What caused the conflict?

I edited the first line of a test.md file in main and made a different edit to the same file in a different branch called merge-conflict-test, and tried to merge the two branches.

How did you resolve it?

Using GitHub Desktop I clicked resolve conlficts in Visual Studio, I went to the IDE and cleared up the changes.

What did you learn?

I learned that these conflicts are more of a fail safe to prevent accidents rather than errors. 

Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

Done
