Research what causes merge conflicts in Git.

Create a merge conflict in your test repo by:
Creating a branch and editing a file.
Switching back to main, making a conflicting edit in the same file, and committing it.
Merging the branch back into main.

Use your Git desktop client to resolve the conflict.

Write about your experience:
What caused the conflict?
How did you resolve it?
What did you learn?

Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
