Agile Workflows & Kanban

🔍 Research & Learn

How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A kanban board can be used to visualiza tasks and prioritize them. They depict tasks as visual cards, and they have columns that depict the stages of development. It gives a 'bird's eye view' of the work, therefore helps to identify bottlenecks by seeing the time spent on each task.

What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
Kanban boards are customisable, however in the board that I created, I have the columns; To do, In progress, In review, Done. 
- To do are all the tasks that are back logged to be done.
- In progress are all the tasks that I am currently working on for example this milestone.
- In review, are all the tasks left to be analyzed by the bot to be given approval.
- Done are all the tasks that have been successfully completed and reviewed.

How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
The tasks move across the columns from left to right. The person who has been assigned for the task is responsible for moving the tasks.

What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
WIP limit is a limit to the number of tasks items that can be present in one column. This prevent too much tasks overflowing in a columns that could lead to a person not being productive by trying to multitask too many tasks.

📝 Reflection

How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban is really helpful when it comes to managing priorities since the top items can be identified from the backlog (To do) and moved to the next column. Using the WIP limits the kanban board helps to really avoid work overload as well.

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
By putting every task to the Kanban board, for example every small bug fix and documentation updates I can really accurately track where my time goes. I can have a clear understanding of what I have to do and plan my future time periods as well accordingly.

🛠️ Task

Create a kanban board for your repo with relevant columns (e.g. not started, in progress, ready for review, approved by bot)
- Done

Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.
- Done

Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
In my role since I will be using GitHub, I can automate the transitioning of tasks by linking GitHub with the Kanban board. Whenever there is a pull request, the kanban card can progress to read for review from in progress. This reduces manual admin work.
