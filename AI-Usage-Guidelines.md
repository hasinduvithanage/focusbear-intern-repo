Use of AI Tools
🎯 Goal
Understand how to responsibly and effectively use AI tools while maintaining data privacy and critical thinking.


❓ Why is this important?
AI tools can boost productivity, but they should be used thoughtfully. Misuse—such as leaking confidential information or relying on AI without critical thinking—can cause serious problems.


🔍 Research & Learn

What AI tools are typically used for your role?
AI tools such as AI-integrated editors, GitHub Copilot, agentic CLI tools or chatbots including OpenAI, Claude and Gemini.

What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?
Benefits:
- Can get prototypes very quickly for example database schemes.
- Can instantly generate unit and integration testing
- Can generate documentation or code comments using code logic very quickly
Drawbacks:
- There will be major security vulnerabilities; for example AI could suggest code that could succumb to SQL injection.
- AI can easily hallucinate and give code that does not do the job properly or is very inefficient.
- Overly relying on AI can lead to code that works but is not maintainable going forward.

What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
- Proprietary source code should never be input into AI tools.
- The entire company repo should not be pasted into AI tools.
- API keys should never be input into AI.
- User data should not be entered into AI.
- Company strategies should not be input into AI.

How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
Once I receive the AI generated code, I can explain it back to myself to see if I fully understand the code, if I do not I should use the code. If I am using AI, I should test the scripts in a local, isolated environment before integrating AI generated scripts into the main branch.


📝 Reflection

When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
I can use AI if I am writing repetetive unit tests, for documentation, assisting in brainstorming.
I should rely on my own skills when making decisions on the architecture of the code, when doing security audits, when optimizing the performance, and I should understand the 'Why' behind a feature for Focus Bear users.

How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
By keeping and adhering to ethical rules. I will keep a rule where I attemp to solve a logic or fix a bug by myself for set amount of time before considering asking AI. I will use AI to speed up my work and not create it from start. 

What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
- Using fake data when asking AI to help with data transforming logics.
- I will strictly follow data privacy protocols by not inputting cofidential and propprietary content into AI platforms.

🛠️ Task

Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
I can improve documentation using AI tools. 

Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?
After having used AI for documentation in the past, I can vouch that it definitely needed rewriting and fact-checking. The actual logic in the documentations were always written by me and AI is mainly used to grammar check and it was also used to adjust formatting and recommend more items that could be included in the documentation.

Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.
The most vital best practise to be followed whenever using AI is to always make sure that I should blindly use what the AI gives me. I will make sure to fully understand the content gathered from the AI before making use of it.
