Task: Compare Focus Bear with Other Productivity Apps
📌 Be completely honest in your evaluation—Focus Bear might not always be better than other tools, and that’s okay! The goal is to understand the competitive landscape and think critically about where Focus Bear stands.

📌 Research other productivity and focus apps such as:

Freedom
Cold Turkey
Tiimo
Routinery
📌 Then, reflect on the following questions:

What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

When compared with Tiimo and Routinery, they are purely just visual planners or routine planners. While Focus Bear has this feature in its aresnal where it differs is that it actively provides website blocking for unwanted. What this does is, it prevents the user from using up the block of time allocated for work on other unwanted distractions. 
Cold Turkey and Freedom are more similar to Focus Bear where they help block websites too. The differences can be seen in Cold Turkey in the way that it is too harsh on its punishments. It is mentioned that it "makes it almost impossible to stop the block once you lock it". This means that even though there is an emergency it would take a lot of time or it won't be possible to veer out of focus session. Focus bear on the other hand is more flexible but still does keep a strong back bone when coming to switching to distractions with a stricter mode "geek mode". Where Focus Bear differs from Freedom is that Focus bear is built with ADHD users in mind. Focus Bear naturally block all unwanted websites unless you put it in an allow list. Where Freedom is primarily focused on blocking, Focus Bear is a full on habit and routine app that includes blocking as a feature.

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

As a user I would choose Focus Bear since it would have all of the features in the other apps whilst giving me the flexibility to choose a stricter mode or simpler mode depending on my work at the time. While Freedom and Cold Turkey simply blocks distractions and Tiimo and Routinery just gives visual routine planners which you can easily ignore, Focus Bear accomodates both these features in its app.

What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

Blocking applications and cutting off the internet is a feature that Focus Bear does not have that other apps have notably Cold Turkey and Freedom.

Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

One improvement that Focus Bear could make is providing a third mode which is increedibly strict and makes it more difficult to get out of a focus session. Make this a different mode like the "geek mode". Giving it as a option will be the best scenario since for some users this option would seem too enforcing if given by default.
