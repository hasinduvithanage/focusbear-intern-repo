What is a “User Manual for Me”, and why do teams use them?
It is almost like an introductory guide for team members to look at to make it easier for them to interact with me. 

What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)
Communication style, work habits, feedback preferences all these categories are helpful to include since they help team members work better with you. They will be better aware of how to send you messages, how to give you feedback, and they will be aware of how your working habits look like so they will know when to approach me and vice versa for me to aprroach other team members.

How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?
It can clarify assumptions that some people might already have about me and is basically an ice breaker which will reduce a lot of misunderstanding. When I confirm my communication styles, work habit and feedback preferences, this will help increase our teamwork since it will be an easier job to communicate with each other.


📝 Reflection

What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)
I prefer direct communication and detailed instructions from teammated for me to do my best work. I feel in this way I can jump straight into the problem solving since I will have fully understood the assignment tasked to me. I do not mind interruptions as I find that I can easily get back into the work afterwards, so feel free to ask me anything at any point.

How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)
I would prefer a quick verbal check in where I am able to ask follow up questions to clarify any doubts that I have. I am also fine with a detailed message as well.

What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)
I would have a structured to-do list and would put myself in a working environment which really helps me focus on the tasks at hand. If I am around other people who are working I feel that I become preoductive as well.

How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)
I would live for me to receive feedback clearly and directly, if possible I would prefer written but verbal I am fine with as well. I like to give feedback with positive reinforcement and encouragements. 

What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)
I would prefer written instrcutions purely because I can go back to it at any time, but I like to discuss verbally as well. You might find me writing down things as we discuss, that is just my way of recording down the discussions so that I do not forget as I go on. I also would like time to process ideas but I will always come back and give my opinions.
