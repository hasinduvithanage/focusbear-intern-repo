# User Manual for Hasindu  

## My role
- I am a Backend Developer Intern
- The days and times I work are:
  Usually:
  - Fridays On-site (Monash Generator)
  - Wednesday Online

## How I Work Best  
- I do my best work when I am in a professional environment and everyone around me is focused on working as well.
- I struggle when there are too many distractions around me.

## Communication Style  
- I prefer messages to be detailed and if possible verbal but I am also fine with calls or messages or emails. 
- The best way to reach me is through Discord or emails. I don't mind calls as well incase the task is urgent. 
- If you need something urgent, call me and send me a message if I am unable to answer the phone at the moment. 

## Collaboration & Teamwork  
- I work best in a team when we all have gotten to know each other pretty well. 
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is not communicating at all.
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I am listening to what is being said intently and thinking of a response or a solution.

## Focus & Productivity  
- I stay focused by outting myself in working environments like a student late lab, library or even by body doubling.
- Things that distract me; if there is a soccer match going on involving Man City! 
- The best way to support my productivity is to just behave the way you would normally do, I don't mind anything as long as we are working towards something together.

## Feedback & Growth  
- I like feedback to be direct, with examples. I would like the feedback to be private if possible but I am fine either way. 
- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is telling me directly.
- I appreciate it when teammates are honest with me and like to socialise.

## Fun Facts & Quirks  
- One thing people often misunderstand about me is that I am not social, I am just more of a listener. I might not always be the loudest in the room, but I genuinely enjoy being around people and connecting in my own way.
- A fun fact about me is that I like to play soccer and I enjoy the casual anime series here and there. 
- My work superpower is that I can get engrossed in a problem until it is fixed if the problem requirements are clear to me.
