# Definition of Done (DoD) in Agile hello

## What is Definition of Done?

The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a clear checklist of criteria that must be satisfied for a task, user story, or feature to be considered complete. It ensures work meets agreed-upon quality standards before being marked as "done."

> Simply put: **DoD is a shared agreement on what "finished" really means.**

---

## Why DoD is Important

- Prevents incomplete or low-quality work from being marked done
- Reduces technical debt
- Increases team accountability
- Ensures consistent quality across features
- Makes releases smoother and more predictable

Without a DoD, teams risk:
- Bugs surfacing in production
- Rewrites and refactoring
- Misaligned expectations with stakeholders

---

## Example of Definition of Done

For a feature like **user login**, the DoD may include:

- ✅ Code is written
- ✅ Code is reviewed and approved
- ✅ Unit tests are written and passing
- ✅ Feature tested by QA
- ✅ No critical bugs
- ✅ Deployed to staging
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Acceptance criteria met

Only when **all items** are satisfied is the feature truly "done."

---

## Key Points

- **DoD is not the same as Acceptance Criteria**: Acceptance criteria define what the feature should do, while DoD defines what it takes for it to be fully complete.
- DoD should be **agreed upon by the whole team**.
- DoD evolves over time as the team matures and quality expectations increase.
