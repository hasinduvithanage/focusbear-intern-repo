Which AI tools did you try?

I have tried ChatGPT, and Github Copilot.

What worked well? What didn’t?

GitHub copilot works really well when I want to review my code and search for bugs. It also has autocomplete for the code that I am writing. With ChatGPT, I can use it really well for debugging and explaining concepts.

When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

AI is most useful for me when I want to get started on something. Instead of starting from a blank page I can use it to give me a kick starter base which I can build on top of. I can use it to explain new concepts and use it to generate new ideas.
