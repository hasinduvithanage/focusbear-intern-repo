Which extensions did you install? Why?

I have installed:
React Developer Tools 
Redux DevTools 
A JSON Viewer 
Lighthouse 


What was the most useful thing you learned?

The most useful thing that I learned through these extensions is seeing how it can bridge the gap for understanding the console.log. These extensions help me obsereve data in real-time, making debugging a whole lot easier.
