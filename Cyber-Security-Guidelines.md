🔍 Research & Learn

What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?
- Phishing emails
- Unsecure personal devices
- Weak passwords

What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?
- By making sure that the latest versions of software are present.
- By making sure that my devices auto lock
- By using strong passwords

Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?
- This will prevent unauthorized physical access.
- Unauthorized users will have access to the company's entire codebase if they get access to the device.

How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?
- Check the sender's email, not just the display name.
- Double check the link before clicking on it.
- Report a phishing email if I come acroos it, so that other can be warned.

What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?
- A strong password should be long, more than 8 characters long
- It should be unique
- It should contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.

Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?
- This is a second layer of protection since if your password stolen, a hacker still will not be able to get in the device wothout the temporary code.
- M2FA should be enabled always.


📝 Reflection

What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I currently use:
- Strong passwords
- M2FA
- Auto device lock
I can decrease the time taken for the device to lock. Make the passwords more lengthier with more unique characters.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
I can do the act again and again consistently. For example, with M2FA I can make this a regular thing by activating it for every one of my accounts till it becomes natural for me to do.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?


What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
