Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

Vulnerable populations consist of neurodivergent individuals, the elderly, people with disabilities, and people with low digital literacy. Some of the challenges they would face in a digital space is that they would be overwhelmed by sensory input, complex navigation systems and manipulative UI will be challenging for vulnerable populations. 

What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)

- Avoiding overwhelming UX by minimizing flashing banners and visual noise in.
- Respecting sensory needs by giving high contrast options and avoiding pop up banners and third party ads.
- Using clear and literal language, so that it is very unlikely for any message to be misinterpreted.

How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)

- By making predictable navigation by keeping the menus and buttons in consistent places in the app so that users can easily fall back to 'what they already know'.
- Simple languag like using bullet points to make text scannable and detailed text that clarifies lingering doubts can be used to make the app more accessible to people with ADHD or Autism.
- Reducing congitive load by breaking long tasks and processes for set up into micro steps and an easy set up that can be approached easier.

How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)
- Be flexible by allowing team members blocks of time where they can work without any distractions.
- By being clear in communication by being very explicit with the message.
- By respecting different work styles by understanding that some people prefer work styles that does not match you. For example, some may not prefer direct and verbal feedback and would prefer written updates.

📝 Reflection

How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
I can give teammated more time to process information in writing rather than putting them on the spot, which would be pressurizing. 

What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
- Too many notifications could be a pitfall for Focus Bear; too many reminders can become a source of anxiety rather than help, which could demotivate the user to keep using the app.
- If the app is too harsh with the punishments when a user misses a habit it can trigger shame in the user.

What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
In my work, I can start highlighting the required action message by making it bold so that the core takeaway is not lost with other context.

🛠️ Task

Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)

Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.
Allow user to plan out the entire day with tasks and let them tag the tasks with 'High Energy' or 'Low Energy'. Using an AI script, the app can plan a day for them where high energy tasks come first and low energy tasks come later in the day, with breaks. This removes the daunting task of planning out the day with all the tasks and allows the user to get a suggestion to how they might approach the tasks on the day.

Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.
Hypothetical scenario: A user is struggling to start their morning routine.
Response: I hear how frustrating it is when you feel stuck. Let me help you breakdown the tasks into smaller sprints that we can tackle more easier. We will focus on one task at hand first before thinking about the rest. Once that is done we can decide the next step together.
