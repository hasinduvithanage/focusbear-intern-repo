🔍 Research & Learn

What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?

Since the screen and keyboard are joined, either the user's hands will be at the wrong position or the screen height will be at the wrong position. 

What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)

Can use laptop stands to increase the screen to eye level. 
Can use an external mouse and keyboard to allow elbows to be at 90 degrees. 
Can use an ergonomic chair to provide support to the vertebrate.

What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?

The monitor should be positioned so that the top third of the screen is at eye level.
Chair should be in a way so that my feet are flat on the ground.
The desk should be in a way where my elbows should form a 90 degree angle.

What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)

Take breaks every 20 minutes while using the laptop to look at something far away for about 20 seconds to reduce strain on eyes.
After every hour, stand up and stretch for 2 minutes.
Make sure that my posture is correct once in a while, so that there will be reduced strain on my back.


📝 Reflection

What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

Using an external monitor alongside external keyboard and mouse will help with neck strain, eye strain, and posture.


What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

By sitting upright leaning back on the chair, the back rest can actually support the back.
By taking regular breaks I can avoid my muscles being tensed up and cramped which avoids strain on muscles. 
Adjusting screen height can avoid strain on the eyes since the distance between the eye and the screen will be at its most optimal and comfortable level.

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

By using the focus bear app, I will be able to schedule movement breaks, this will greatly help with muscle strain and I will great a breath of fresh air at the same time.

🛠️ Task

Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.
Done

Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.
A laptop stand which I got for my home setup.

Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)
Will do!

Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
I used my recent laptop stand in my home workspace to raise the screen by 15cm so that there is less strain on my neck and eyes.
