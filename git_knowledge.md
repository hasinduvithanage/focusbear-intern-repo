Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

Yes, I have used it for my university studies (IT group projects).

Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

GitHub Desktop, since the GUI was visually enticing and was easier to get my head around when I started using Git.

What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

When you create a branch in Git, it does not copy your code it just creates a pointer to a commit, so branching is very fast and lightweight.
