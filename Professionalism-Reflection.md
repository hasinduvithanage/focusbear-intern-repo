Professionalism at Focus Bear

🔍 Research & Learn

What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)
Professional:
- Always being respectful and accomodating when speaking with others.
- Being on time to meetings and professional events.
- Being helpful whenever I can for example sharing helpful documentation I find with the team.

Unprofessional:
- Using offensive slangs, or using all caps when texting inappropriately.
- Taking solo credit for something that was done as a team.
- Not respecting other team members time and opinions.

What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)
- Always assuming positive intent behind messages. Since there are not any physical cues, we should not jump to conclusions.
- If there is a disagreement that seems to be carrying on for a while, we can take a quick voice call to settle it. If the disagreement still follows, can add an external third party to get their opinion as well.
- Always acknowledge that I have seen a message  even with a thumbs up.


How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)
- By always focusing on actions we can get to the actual issue at hand instead of it coming across as offensive.
- By always assuming good intent we are able to receive feedback professionally, since we are able to focus on the actual issue at hand which will speed up the process of getting to a solution. 
- By reacting the appropriate way for feedback we can avoid being defensive and can ask for clarification which will help get to the point.

📝 Reflection

Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

I have witnessed great teamwork and professionalism at my previous placement. It was very effective because the team member were all openly honest with one another and we never took anything the wrong way. If a team member came up to me and told me that I could something a certain way, I would consider it and implement the solution whilst giving them credit if it works and if it does not I would explain my point of view and how I approached the problem to reach an understanding. 


What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
I would put myself in the shoes of the person I am trying to communicate with and see how I would respond if I got the message or feedback. Taking this into account I will edit my message to better accomodate the person I am going to communicate with.

How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
By taking things lightly and lifting the mood by reacting appropriately to socializing cues.

How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
ALways arrive with things prepared to talk about. For example, what I have done, where I am stuck and what I plan to do next.

What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
After finishing task I should not pause all my activity but I will start writing tests for it, updating documentation and looking at the next task to be done. 
If I am stuck trying to solve a bug for more than 1 hour, I will go to my supervisor and mention everything that I have tried and request assistance to be pointed in the correct direction.

How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? 
Ask first by sending a message containing all the details needed. If the reqeust is urgent send a polite reminder in 3-4 hours.

How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
If I don't get a response within a considerate amount of time, I will ask the same question in a public repository to see if any other persons may be able to help. I will only escalate an issue, if there is no reply for more than a full working day or if there is a major deadline for the issue.

What are some things you won't do?
- I will not ghost someone else. If I do not have an answer I will first acknowledge the message and then mention that I will work on getting an answer.
- I will not make assumptions on critical tasks and will make sure to clarify before pushing a code.
- I will not push unchecked code in the repo.
- I will not make un realistic demands or promises, I will be respectful towards others and I will also acknowledge a realistic time schedule for a task to be done.
