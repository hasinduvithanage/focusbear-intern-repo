Professionalism at Focus Bear

🔍 Research & Learn

What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)
Professional:
- Always being respectful and accomodating when speaking with others.
- Being on time to meetings and professional events.
- Being helpful whenever I can for example sharing helpful documentation I find with the team.

Unprofessional:
- Using offensive slangs, or using all caps when texting inappropriately.
- Taking solo credit for something that was done as a team.
- Not respecting other team members time and opinions.

What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)
- Always assuming positive intent behind messages. Since there are not any physical cues, we should not jump to conclusions.
- If there is a disagreement that seems to be carrying on for a while, we can take a quick voice call to settle it. If the disagreement still follows, can add an external third party to get their opinion as well.
- Always acknowledge that I have seen a message  even with a thumbs up.


How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)
- By always focusing on actions we can get to the actual issue at hand instead of it coming across as offensive.
- By always assuming good intent we are able to receive feedback professionally, since we are able to focus on the actual issue at hand which will speed up the process of getting to a solution. 
- By reacting the appropriate way for feedback we can avoid being defensive and can ask for clarification which will help get to the point.
