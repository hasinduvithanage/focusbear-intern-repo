📝 Reflection

What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
- Make sure to never veer from the best practises for handling confidential data.
- Never hard code API keys in the codebase.
- Always have a peer or mentor review the code to catch flaws.

How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
- I would store sensitive files only in company-approved cloud storage rather than local drives.
- Share sensitive information over secure links, which I can also add an expiry date to.
- I would make sure that information is deleted permanently even from the recycle bin, when deleting files. 

What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
- Using production data in a development environment - use pseudo data for this. 
- Uploading the entire codebase to AI tools to get help from AI - only enter non-proprietary code into AI tools to get help, and even then only a small section specifically the problem at hand.


🛠️ Task

Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.

The habit of only collecting and using the bare minimum of information needed to complete a task.


Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.

To protect user privacy I will use fake user data; for example I will not use real user data when I am testing new features. This reduces the chance of me accidentally leaking the user data.
