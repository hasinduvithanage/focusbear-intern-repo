*What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?*
- Agile is an iterative approach to development. In this method, all entities work together in an incremental fashion which also inlcudes regular feedback intervals as well.
- Traditional project management systems however are different. The main traditional project management system would be the waterfall method where the project is done in a chronological order. In this method the project phases do not move forwards until the prior phase has been completed.
- Comparing the two methods, the traditional method is much more rigid and linear, whereas Agile is more iterative and flexible.

*What are the core values and principles of Agile?*
The core values of Agile are:
- focus on customer satisfaction
- Adapting and changing as needed according to milestones
- frequent updates
- teamwork
- communication
- quality
- continous reflections and improvements
  These core values of Agile fit perfectly with a software development project since building an App requires all of the above values.
