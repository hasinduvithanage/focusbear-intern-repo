*🔍 Research & Learn*

*What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?*
- Agile is an iterative approach to development. In this method, all entities work together in an incremental fashion which also inlcudes regular feedback intervals as well.
- Traditional project management systems however are different. The main traditional project management system would be the waterfall method where the project is done in a chronological order. In this method the project phases do not move forwards until the prior phase has been completed.
- Comparing the two methods, the traditional method is much more rigid and linear, whereas Agile is more iterative and flexible.

*What are the core values and principles of Agile?*
The core values of Agile are:
- focus on customer satisfaction
- Adapting and changing as needed according to milestones
- frequent updates
- teamwork
- communication
- quality
- continous reflections and improvements
  These core values of Agile fit perfectly with a software development project since building an App requires all of the above values.

*What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?*
The main difference between Scrum and Kanban are that Kanban has a continous workflow without a start and end date whereas Scrum has Sprints where they are regular, fixed lengths where work is done. There are no roles in Kanban but in Scrum there are roles like the Scrum Master for example. In Kanband tasks flow through as soon as there is availability for work, Scrum uses an iterative approach to completing projects. 

*Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?*
There are many benefits of choosing Kanban. Compared to Scrum Kanban is more suitable to be used for a project that needs constantly changing priorities as it can be adapted into the workflow since in Kanban work is done continously. Since FocusBear is an app that can involve constant feedback from the community, Kanban will be better suited as changes can be made more easier. 
Kanban also has a visual board which can be used to instantly see if tasks are piling up, and it can be used to add new tasks and can prioritize tasks accordingly. This is much useful to Focus bear since in app development small updates would be needed to be pushed frequently, so Kanban can be used to release the updates whenever they are ready instead of being restricted by a start date and end date like it is in Scrum. 

*📝 Reflection*
*What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?*
Agiles' biggest strength is its flexibility; since we work in small cycles with regular feedback we can quickly change directions if a feature is not working or if users need new features. This leads to higher customer satisfaction. Furthermore, since there is constant communication in an agile method, there will be more team transparency which can catch early errors before they become a bigger problem later on.

On the other hand to use Agile it needs a big mindset shift to work effectively especially if a person is switching to agile after using traditional methods. For people used to clear plans and end goals, the lack of predictability will be difficult to manage in terms of budgeting and marketing. Since there's no end goal it's easy to add features until it goes over budget.

*How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?*

The agile principles of iterative development can help me focus on progress. It can help break down massive features into a viable product that I will be able to work on and build up towards. I can also get regular, constant feedback from my supervisor and the team early on; this will make sure that I am on the right track aligning with the target instead of wasting hours of my time on the wrong solution. 
By practicing regular reflections that come with iterative development, I can also continously improve my own skills while updating my understanding of the project.

*🛠️ Task

Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.*

Scrum are blocks of work that have a start and end date, which works on a solution, a Sprint at a time. In Kanban, there is a continous workflow where new tasks get added and then become listed in a priority list. In Kanban it doesn't matter how old a task is a new task can overtake it if it is deemed as more important. Scrum uses regular meetings and roles to stay organized, but Kanban focuses on  visualizing the work needed to do and lets you swap priorities if resources allow it. 

*Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.*
The principle of continous reflections and improvements will be most useful to my work since it will turn every work cycle of mine into a learning experience. Instead of working by myself and hoping for the best, frequent check ins with the team can help me catch errors and will make sure that I stay on track of my project goals.
